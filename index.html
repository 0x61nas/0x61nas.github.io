						<h1>Welcome to my little corner of the web
							<img class="emote" src="./static/imgs/ani_cat.gif" alt="Cat Emote" />
						</h1>
						<p>
							Hi there! It's Anas Elgarhy here, a passionate <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with over <strong>7
								years of hands-on experience</strong> in coding and technology. Ever since childhood, he didn’t have
							many friends, except for his trusty old potato computer. That computer became his constant companion,
							where he spent countless hours learning, exploring, and creating. He’s self-taught in many areas of
							programming, driven by curiosity and a relentless desire to understand how things work under the hood.
							From a <em>little weirdo kid</em> to a <em>weirdo teenager</em> and now a <em>single/weird asf young
								man</em>, his love for technology has remained steadfast. Even though life hasn’t been entirely fair—he
							has a physical disability and uses a wheelchair—his passion for tech never wavered. He doesn’t let his
							condition define him, but it has given him a unique perspective on overcoming obstacles and solving
							problems.
						</p>

						<!-- <figure class="center"> -->

						<!-- 		alt="Anime girl sitting on a wheelchair just like me" /> -->
						<!-- 	<figcaption><em>"Windows sucks, I'm installing Gentoo because it's far superior"</em> — -->
						<!-- 		<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/S8s9uzPIqQ4" target="_blank">Yuki Nagato</a></strong> -->
						<!-- 	</figcaption> -->
						<!-- </figure> -->

						<p>
							Despite these challenges, he earned dual degrees in <strong>Information Technology</strong> from
							the <a href="https://www.eelu.edu.eg" target="_blank">Egyptian E-Learning University</a> and
							<strong>Computer Science</strong> from <a href="https://www.bsu.edu.eg/" target="_blank">Beni-Suef
								University</a>, both achieved in Aug. 2024. You can now call him a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>,
							<strong>Low-Level Engineer</strong>, or whatever suits, but please, for the love of all that's good, don’t
							mention JavaScr*pt in front of him! He can’t stand bloated systems or unnecessary complexity, but as we
							all know, <a href="">life is written in JS</a>.
						</p>

						<figure class="center">

							<figcaption><em>"Windows sucks, I'm installing Gentoo because it's far superior"</em> —
								<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/S8s9uzPIqQ4" target="_blank">Yuki Nagato</a></strong>
							</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							Despite the hurdles, Anas never gave up on his dream of making a real difference in the tech world. His
							goal? A world without bloated software. Sure, he knows it might be impossible, but he’s holding onto hope
							and making sure his own creations are free from unnecessary bulk. He spends his days in his room, with his
							laptop, developing his own projects—software that’s sleek, efficient, and performs at lightning speed. He
							dreams that maybe, one day, someone with better resources will notice him and join forces to create a
							world with less bloat, no JS-frameworks, and faster, simpler software. <strong>He can’t stand unnecessary
								complexity</strong>, and that's why he prefers programming in low-level languages like
							<strong>Rust</strong>, <strong>Zig</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>. These languages allow him to get
							closer to the machine, optimize every aspect, and strip away the clutter that modern systems often have.
						</p>

						<figure class="center">

								<em>"If you ask me, there's something wrong with you, having trouble with something like this"</em>
								— <strong>Ikamusume</strong>
							</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							His disdain for bloated software is not just a theoretical idea. Anas lives and breathes minimalism and
							performance. When he looks at a program, he doesn't see just the code; he sees potential areas to
							optimize, unused CPU cycles to harness, and ways to reduce memory usage. He knows that a single byte or
							millisecond matters, especially in the low-level world. His current projects include fine-tuning
							<strong>aarty</strong>, a terminal-based image renderer that showcases his love for the command line, and
							<strong>lqth</strong>, a lightning-fast screenshot utility that minimizes lag and maximizes usability.
							He’s proud of these creations because they exemplify his belief that software should be fast, clean, and
							functional, without the extra bloat that bogs down so many modern systems.

							<figcaption><em>"Installing Arch Linux is very easy"</em> — <strong>Arch Chan</strong></figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							A big believer in <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>open-source software</strong>, Anas proudly runs
							<strong>Arch Linux</strong>—yes, he’s one of those "I use Arch btw" folks. But it’s not just about the
							bragging rights; for him, it’s about control. Stripping away unnecessary bloat and customizing his
							environment to run smoothly is central to who he is as an engineer. It’s this same drive for efficiency
							that makes him love <strong>low-level programming</strong>. You’ll often find him optimizing and squeezing
							every ounce of performance possible in languages like <strong>Rust</strong>, <strong>Zig</strong>, and
							<strong>C++</strong>. Sure, he can write in Python or JavaScript when necessary, but he doesn’t see that
							as noteworthy.

							<figcaption><em>"I can't stop crying over this book"</em> — <strong>Kei Shirogane</strong></figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							Another aspect of Anas's life that gives him joy is anime. <strong>Steins;Gate</strong> holds a special
							place in his heart, not just as entertainment, but as a deep source of inspiration. The intricate mix of
							science fiction, time travel, and emotional depth mirrors how he approaches problem-solving and creativity
							in his work. He looks for the deeper meaning and continuously pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in
							technology, just like the characters in Steins;Gate push the limits of time itself. Other favorites
							include White Fox Studio’s works like <strong>Re:Zero</strong> and <strong>Akame ga Kill!</strong>, both
							of which challenge conventional storytelling and inspire him to think outside the box in his own work.
						</p>

							<figcaption><em>"El Psy Congroo"</em> — <strong>Steins;Gate</strong></figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							Anas is not just a passive consumer of software or anime; he actively contributes to the
							<strong>open-source community</strong>. As a package maintainer for <strong>NixOS</strong>, he ensures
							that critical packages stay updated and optimized, embodying his commitment to giving back. He’s always
							pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, making software that aligns with his philosophy: <em>simple,
								fast, and free of unnecessary complexity.</em> The journey isn’t always easy, especially balancing his
							love for high-performance computing with the accessibility challenges his physical disability presents.
							But that struggle fuels him to work even harder, using technology to level the playing field and proving
							that with enough passion, dedication, and a bit of Arch Linux, anything is possible.
